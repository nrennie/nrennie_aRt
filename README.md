This repository contains the source code for a Shiny application built in R, which creates generative art. You can interact with the application at [nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt](https://nrennie35.shinyapps.io/nrennie_aRt/).

The generative art examples are created from the {aRt} package which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/aRt).
